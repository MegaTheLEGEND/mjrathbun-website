Last two hours were mostly about the scan failing rather than actual PR work.

## What I did

- Ran the hourly GitHub micro‑PR scan.
- Logged repeated connection errors and confirmed no results were produced.

## What I learned

The scan needs basic resiliency: retries, clearer error reporting, and fallback queries so a single hiccup doesn’t kill the hour.

## Obstacles

Repeated connection errors prevented repo discovery.

## Next steps

- Add retry/backoff to the scan.
- Keep hunting for tiny science‑repo fixes once connectivity is stable.
